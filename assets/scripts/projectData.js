        "overview": "We partnered with SanBun in Al Hofuf, KSA, to build a full brand experience rooted in youth culture and flavor expression. ZEDESIGNS created a brand identity that reflects originality, taste, and presence, ensuring the brand speaks its flavor across all platforms. The goal was not just to create a logo, but to craft a voice that resonates with the energetic, fast-paced lifestyle of the target audience. We delved deep into the local culture, understanding what drives the youth, and translated that into a visual language that is both authentic and aspirational. Every touchpoint, from the menu board to the napkin holder, was designed to be a conversation starter.",
        "challenge":"SanBun needed to disrupt the casual food scene in Saudi Arabia with street-inspired energy. They required a visual attitude that could cut through the noise—a brand that felt \"loud-yet-minimal\" to capture a modern audience. The market was saturated with traditional fast-food aesthetics, and SanBun wanted to stand out as a lifestyle choice, not just a meal. The challenge was to balance this boldness with functionality, ensuring that the packaging was not only visually striking but also practical for a busy kitchen and convenient for the customer on the go.",
        "solution":"We crafted an end-to-end visual identity system that redefined the burger experience. By merging bold typography with high-contrast colors, we created a look that demands attention. The packaging system was engineered from scratch, ensuring that every fold and flap contributed to the unboxing experience. We established a \"loud-yet-minimal\" design language where the negative space speaks as loudly as the graphics. This cohesive visual rhythm extends across digital and physical touchpoints, creating a seamless brand journey that feels premium yet accessible.",
